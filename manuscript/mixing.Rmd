\begin{abstract}
Sedimentary deposits constitute the primary record of changing environmental conditions that have acted on Earth's surface over geologic time. Clastic material is eroded from source locations (parents) in sediment routing systems and deposited at sink locations (children). Both parents and children have characteristics that vary across many different dimensions, including grain size, chemical composition, and the geochronologic age of constituent detrital minerals. During transport, sediment from different parents is mixed together to form a child, which in turn may serve as the parent for other sediment further down system or later in time when buried sediment is exhumed. The distribution of detrital mineral ages observed in parent and child sediments allows for investigation of the proportion of each parent in the child sediment which reflects the properties of the sediment routing system. To model the proportion of dates in a child sample that comes from each of the parent distributions, we use a Bayesian mixture of Dirichlet processes. This model allows for estimation of the mixing proportions with associated uncertainty while making minimal assumptions. We also present an extension to the model whereby we reconstruct unobserved parent distributions from multiple observed child distributions using mixtures of Dirichlet processes. The model accounts for uncertainty in both the number of mineral formation events that compose each parent distribution and the mixing proportions of each parent distribution that composes a child distribution. To demonstrate the model, we perform analyses using simulated data where the true age distribution is known as well as using a real world case study from the central California, USA coast.

\end{figure}


To understand the origins of modern and ancient landscapes one must understand how erosional processes and associated sedimentary basins evolve through time \citep{romans2016environmental}. As clastic material is generated by weathering and erosion, it is subsequently transported downstream, mixed, and ultimately deposited into a depositional sink. Statistical modeling of sediment mixing allows for inference about processes that generated the modern landscape. The ability to decipher the relative proportions of sources that eroded to produce sediment informs understanding of the underlying geologic processes controlling the evolution of the Earth's surface \citep{stock2006does,sharman2019conversion,mason2017climatic,kimbrough2015detrital}.

One of the most common ways to characterize the provenance of sediment is detrital geochronology -- dating the time at which the individual minerals that make up a sedimentary rock formed or cooled. These mineralization events typically reflect the timing of igneous rock forming events or metamorphic alteration of source rocks \citep{gehrels2014detrital}. In other cases mineral ages reflect the history of mineral cooling (e.g., 'thermochronology', \citep{reiners2006using}). Detrital geochronologic ages are most commonly determined from measurements of radiogenic isotopes contained within individual mineral crystals. The decay of uranium (U) to lead (Pb) within zircon, a relatively robust mineral, makes this approach ideally suited for tracking sedimentary mixing \citep{amidon2005u,sundell2017unmixing,sharman2017sediment}. While the date of a geochronometer from a particular source may be insensitive to the post-formation history of the mineral because of the high closure-temperature of geochronometers (e.g., on the order of 1000 C for zircon U-Pb \citep{cherniak2001pb}), the same can not be expected of low-temperature thermochronometers (e.g., at a typical cooling rate apatite U-Th/He has a closure temperature of ~60 C \citep{flowers2009apatite}). Detrital minerals with low-closure temperatures derived from a single source may have ages that were impacted by the burial of sediments \citep{fosdick2015detrital} or progressive exhumation of sources \citep{garver1999exhumation}. In addition, there is increasing recognition that using multiple isotopic approaches to characterize individual minerals, such as measuring zircon chemistry in addition to age \citep{gehrels2014detrital} or both the U-Pb and U-Th/He age of a zircon \citep{reiners2005u}, are critical for discriminating between sources with indistinct U-Pb ages. While new methods can provide increasing specificity to provenance studies, many past and ongoing studies rely on measurements of age alone and thus we focus on developing an approach to better characterizing the uncertainty in inferences made from those data, recognizing that the method we present here can be extended to multiple dimensions as the need arises.

We will follow the convention that sediment sources are called *parents* and sink locations are called *children*. Because the statistical model is not defined mechanistically, the definition of the parent source is flexible enough to accommodate different scales. For example, a river could be considered the parent source sediment to a marine basin (as in the natural case study presented later in the manuscript). If rivers are considered the children, then the parent sources may be the upstream tributaries or distinctive bedrock domains within the upstream catchment. Using this language, the manuscript aims to address two questions. First, can we estimate the proportion of each parent age distribution in a child age distribution with associated uncertainty? Second, can we estimate the age distributions for unobserved parents given a set of child age distributions? These questions are answered using "top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches to sediment unmixing, respectively (see Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}; \citep{sharman2017sediment}). The top-down approach (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}a) models one or more child samples as a mixture of specified parent samples. The bottom-up approach (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}b) uses multiple child samples to model likely parents which are more generally referred to as end-members in mixture modeling efforts \citep{weltje1997end,paterson2015new}. 

Bayesian mixture modeling of geologic data, including detrital data, has the advantage of explicitly quantifying uncertainty \citep{ward2010including,cooper2017extended,blake2018deconvolutional}. For geochronologic data, Bayesian methods have been used to estimate the age distribution when addressing single samples with probabilistic estimates \citep{jasra2006bayesian}. We extend the work of \citet{jasra2006bayesian} to multiple sample locations by modeling the geologic mixing of sediments derived from source areas containing minerals recording different crystallization events. A key feature of these data are that the age distributions are mutlimodal due to a range of mineral formation events for a given mineral. Thus, an implicit assumption is that each mode in the age distribution is the result of a distinct mineral formation event.

We demonstrate the utility of the Bayesian approach using both a synthetic dataset and a well-constrained, natural case study in central California, USA \citep{sickmann2016detrital}. In the simulated data, the model is shown empirically to recover the simulated age distributions. After better understanding model performance with simulated data, the model is applied to the case study dataset from central California. The top-down mixing approach is able to successfully reconstruct parent contributions in both the synthetic and natural datasets. Although the bottom-up unmixing model is able to successfully reconstruct parents in the synthetic dataset, there is evidence of non-identifiability -- where parents cannot be uniquely characterized from the children -- when applied to the natural dataset. Although the focus of this work is on sediment age distributions, the framework presented here can also give guidance about other scientific questions that relate to mixing of non-parametric sum-to-one data in Earth sciences and other disciplines (e.g., unmixing sediment grain size distribution; \citet{weltje1997end} and references within)

\section{Model Overview}

To define the statistical model, we follow the convention that letters represent data and Greek symbols represent parameters. A plaintext symbol (y/$\theta$) represents a scalar, a bold lowercase symbol ($\mathbf{y}$/$\boldsymbol{\theta}$) represents a vector, and a bold uppercase symbol ($\mathbf{Z}$/$\boldsymbol{\Theta}$) is a matrix whose columns are vectors written as $\mathbf{Z} = \left( \mathbf{z}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{z}_p \right)$ or $\boldsymbol{\Theta} = \left( \boldsymbol{\theta}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{\theta}_p\right)'$ where the appropriate dimensions are implied. We use the notation $[ y ]$ to represent the probability distribution/mass function (pdf/pmf) and let $[ y | \theta ]$ represent the conditional pdf/pmf of the random variable $y$ given $\theta$.

Following \citet{berliner2003physical}, the statistical model described below is divided into three components: the data model, the process model, and the prior model. In general, the data model defines probability distributions that describe the variability in the data due to the measurement process. The data model can be modified to account for non Gaussian measurement processes like counts, outliers, spatial/temporal correlations, etc \citep{tipton2017reconstruction,hefley2017bias}. Process models describe the best scientific understanding of the process of interest. For example, process models have been used to describe the monthly response of trees to climate \citep{tipton2015treeRing}, the relationship between climate and pollen in sediments \citep{tipton2019predicting}, and the movement of ice sheets in Antarctica \citep{chang2016calibrating,guan2018inferring}. For the sediment mixing model, the two processes we attempt to capture with the statistical model are 1) the mineral formation events and 2) the erosional/weathering, transport,ƒ and filtering of grain ages from parent sources to children sinks. The prior model describes the range of parameter values that are plausible and completes the formal mathematical definition of the model by guaranteeing that that posterior distribution is proper (i.e., integrates to 1). 

\section{Top-down mixing model}
\label{mix}
The model framework presented below, which is appropriate for situations where the parent and children sediment have been independently characterized, will answer the first research question: can one estimate the proportion of each parent that comprises the child sediment with appropriate estimates of uncertainty? 

\subsection{Top-down mixing data model}
\label{mix:data}
Let $\mathbf{y}$ be a $n_y$-vector of observed age measurements of a single child of interest and let $\mathbf{z}_b$ be a $n_b$-vector of observed date measurements for each of the $b = 1, \ldots, B$ parents. Because the observed ages include measurement uncertainty reported as a standard deviation, we explicitly account for this source of uncertainty in the data model. In the case of U-Pb dating of detrital zircon grains, dates are most commonly determined using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry \citep{gehrels2012detrital}. Such date measurements typically have relative 2$\sigma$ analytical precision of 1-4\%, with relative uncertainty increasing for younger analyses \citep{puetz2018statistical}. For each detrital mineral, the analytical uncertainty (in standard deviations) for the child is reported as the $n_y$-vector $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{y}$ and for each of the $b = 1, \ldots, B$ parents as a $n_b$-vector $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{z_b}$ . We assume the date measurement uncertainty follows a Gaussian distribution where the observed sediment grain date is

\begin{align*}
\numberthis\label{eq:data-model}
\mathbf{y} | \tilde{\mathbf{y}}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_y^2 & \sim \operatorname{N} (\tilde{\mathbf{y}}, \operatorname{diag} ( \boldsymbol{\sigma}_y^2 ) ), \\
\mathbf{z}_b | \tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{z_b}^2 & \sim \operatorname{N} (\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b, \operatorname{diag} ( \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{z_b}^2 ) ),
\end{align*}

where $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ is a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. The notation $\operatorname{diag} (\boldsymbol{\sigma^2})$ represents a diagonal covariance matrix with $i,i$th element $\sigma^2_i$ and off diagonal elements all equal to 0. We break the variable naming convention and let $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b$ be latent parameters that represent the true, unobserved age of the sediments where $\boldsymbol{y}$ ($\boldsymbol{z}_b$) will be close to $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ ($\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b$) because the measurement uncertainty is small relative to the variability in the data (i.e., the average coefficient of variation of measured dates, defined as the dating standard deviation divided by the estimated date, is about 2-3%). The reason we account for age dating uncertainty is twofold. First, in a perfect world we could measure the mineral dates exactly; however, in practice our measurements introduce some uncertainty such that our data are approximations of a true, unknown age. Second, because of this, the model can give more weight to dates with less uncertainty and vice versa. In this way, it is possible within the model framework to combine data from different minerals that have different dating uncertainties in a principled manner. In addition, it is possible to account for more uncertainty in the data or to account for asymmetric measurement uncertainties using a Student's-t, log-normal, or other distribution instead of the normal distribution \citep{jasra2006bayesian}. However, these extensions were not explored in the current work to minimize the number of parameters to estimate in this proof of concept model framework.

\subsection{Top-down mixing process model}
\label{mix:process}


The process model addresses two scientific questions. First, what are the estimates of the true, unobserved detrital mineral age distributions at the parent and child locations? Second, what proportions of those detrital minerals did each parent source contribute to the child? There are many different methods available to model geochronological age distributions from sample data, including kernel density estimation \citep{vermeesch2012visualisation}, non-negative matrix factorization \citep{saylor2019characterizing}, and Bayesian nonparametric models of mineral formation event mixing \citep{jasra2006bayesian,tye2019bayesian}. The following section details how our understanding of the geologic processes that generated the observed data inform the development of the statistical model.

Over geologic time, individual minerals may be repeatedly recycled into sedimentary rocks by erosion, transport, deposition, and exhumation. However, in many cases the dates recorded by individual minerals contained in these deposits are distinctive and unaffected by these recycling processes (e.g., excluding burial reheating of low temperature thermochronometers \citep{fosdick2015detrital}). We assume that minerals created by the same geologic event share an age distribution that is relatively homogeneous with only small variability. Furthermore, we characterize episodes of rock and mineral formation as punctuated events (typically lasting $10^5$ to $10^7$ years \citep{chen1982uranium,irwin1999plutons,wotzlaw2013tracking}), which are nearly discrete events relative to the age of Earth (approximately $4.5 \times 10^9$ years). While minerals often show overgrowths of different ages, this provides a useful approximation. Under the conceptual model (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}), sediment at each parent is formed by the decomposition of rocks containing minerals created at different times where the potential mineral creation events are shared across parents. Although all parents share the same potential mineral formation events, this does not imply that each parent will actually contain minerals from these potential events. The parent sediments are then mixed producing sediment that has the potential to be present at every child location. The model assumes the system is closed so that the sediment at each child comes entirely from the parent sources. Therefore, each child sediment is composed of minerals from the parent sources that are created by an unknown number of mineral formation events at source locations.

\label{fig:clustering}
\end{figure}

A common choice for modeling a mixture of unknown distributions is the Dirichlet process. Figure 2 demonstrates visually an example simulation from the Dirichlet process model. Mathematically, a Dirichlet Process is constructed over an infinite-dimensional mixture of base measures $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for a family of probability measures $G(\cdot)$ and parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. However, despite the Dirichlet Process being infinite-dimensional, the expected number of clusters scales logarthmically with respect to sample size \citep{ghosal2010dirichlet} which induces sparsity and makes it easy to numerically approximate the infinite mixture with a finite number of clusters $K$ much, much less that the sample size $n$. Thus, even though the true number of mineral formation events $K$ recorded by a detrital sample is unknown, the *a priori* expected number of clusters can be determined using the sample size with a fixed $K$ chosen much larger than the expected number of clusters to ensure a good finite approximation. 

Figure \ref{fig:kernels} shows an example simulation from the Dirichlet process prior using a finite approximation with a mixture of $K$ Gaussian distributions. Each of the shaded colors is a Gaussian distribution where the each distinct color shade depicts a discrete mineral formation event. The means and variances differ for each of the distributions reflecting that formation events can arise from various geologic processes (Fig. \ref{fig:kernels}). The transition from Fig. \ref{fig:kernels} to Fig. \ref{fig:weighted-colored} represents the statistical process model which accounts for geological characteristics and processes including aerial extent, differential erosion, the abundance of minerals of different ages within different rocks, and other factors that influence the proportion of minerals of a given age in sediment at a site \citep{amidon2005construction,amidon2005u}. Figure \ref{fig:weighted-colored} shows the age distributions in Fig. \ref{fig:kernels} that have been re-weighted to account for all of the geological factors determining the mixing proportions of the possible formation events for the parent.

Figure \ref{fig:weighted} depicts a realization from the process model for a given parent. The labels ($k = 1,\ldots, K$) for each mineral formation event are not observed. Thus, the simulated observation distribution only records the age of the detrital minerals in sediment and the color shading is dropped representing this lack of knowledge about the labels. The data are not observations of the mixture density in Fig. \ref{fig:weighted} but are actually a finite sample taken from from the mixture which is shown as a rug plot where each tick on the y axis represents an observed detrital mineral grain date. Thus, the number of mineral formation events is potentially challenging to extract from the data as neither the true age dating density nor the labels that identify the underlying formation events are known.

\subsubsection{Modeling parent sediment ages}

Let the $i=1, \ldots, n_b$ latent detrital sediment grain ages from parent $b$ be represented by $\tilde{z}_{ib}$. The sediment grain from which we estimate the latent age $\tilde{z}_{ib}$ from the observed age $z_{ib}$ is assumed to come from a single mineral formation event implying the mixture distribution over mineral formation events

\begin{align*}
\tilde{z}_{ib} | \boldsymbol{\mu}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_b, \gamma_{i b} & \sim \begin{cases}
\operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{b1}, \sigma_{b1}^2 \right) & \mbox{ if } \gamma_{ib} = 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{bK}, \sigma_{bK}^2 \right) & \mbox{ if } \gamma_{ib} = K, \\
\end{cases}
\numberthis\label{eq:discrete-mixture}
\end{align*}

where $\gamma_{ib}$ is a categorical random variable whose value indicates which formation event $k$ the detrital mineral comes from. We assume the probability of a detrital mineral coming from formation event $k$ is $p_{bk} \equiv P(\gamma_{ib} = k)$. Then, we write the joint distribution over all mineral grains from parent $b$ as

\begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b | \boldsymbol{\mu}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_b, \boldsymbol{\gamma}_{b} & \sim \prod_{i=1}^{n_b} 
\operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{b1}, \sigma_{b1}^2 \right)^{ I\{ \gamma_{ib} = 1\} } \operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{b2}, \sigma_{b2}^2 \right)^{ I\{ \gamma_{ib} = 2\} }
\cdots
\operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{bK}, \sigma_{bK}^2 \right)^{ I\{ \gamma_{ib} = K \} } 
\numberthis\label{eq:integrated-mixture}
\end{align*}

where $I\{ \gamma_{ib} = k\}$ is an indicator function that takes the value 1 if $\gamma_{ib} = k$ and 0 otherwise. Because there are a large number of indicator functions, we integrate them out of the process model to improve mixing and model fit. The integrated age distribution model is

\begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b | \boldsymbol{\mu}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_b, \boldsymbol{p}_{b} & \sim \prod_{i=1}^{n_b} \sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk} \operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{z}_{ib} \middle| \mu_{bk}, \sigma^2_{bk} \right) 
\numberthis\label{eq:parent}
\end{align*}

where $\mathbf{p}_b = (p_{b1}, \ldots, p_{bK})'$ is a vector of positive mixing probabilities with $\sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk} = 1$. To account for uncertainty in the number of formation events $K$, the probabilities $\mathbf{p}_b$ can be modeled using the Dirichlet process as described in detail in Sect. \ref{mix:prior}. In the model as written, the assumption is that there could be a different set of mineral formation events for each parent. However, as these different events could be jointed to form a superset of all events common across locations, we will assume that all formation events are potentially shared among parents to simplify the fitting algorithm.


\subsubsection{Modeling children sediment ages}

The process model specifies the proportion of each parent distribution in the child distribution. We represent the mixing proportions of the $B$ parent distributions for the child of interest with the parameter $\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_B)'$, with $\sum_{b=1}^B \phi_b = 1$ and $\phi_{b} > 0$. The parameter $\phi_b$ is the proportion of the child distribution that comes from parent $b$ and accounts for differential mixing of parents. As the statistical model is not mechanistic, the specific, geologic interpretation of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ changes based on the context of the sediment transport system. For example, when the parents that are comprised of bedrock, $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is a function of each parent's relative aerial extent in the drainage catchment, average erosion rate, and average concentration of the detrital mineral of interest \citep{amidon2005construction}. If parents are sediment inputs (e.g., rivers), then $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is a function of each parent’s relative sediment supply and the average concentration of the detrital mineral of interest within the sediment.

For a single latent child sediment mineral date $\tilde{y}_i$, the sediment grain for that mineral comes from only one parent. Using a categorical variable, the distribution of the child sediment grain can be written as a weighted mixture of components (similar to (\ref{eq:discrete-mixture})) where each component is a weighted sum of the parent distributions (i.e., the sum is over the $K$ weighted densities in (\ref{eq:parent}) but the mixture density is evaluated with child observations rather than the parent observations). Then, the latent indicator variables can be integrated out of the mixture, similar to (\ref{eq:parent}), giving the integrated child age distribution model


\begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i | \{ \boldsymbol{\mu}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_b, \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \boldsymbol{\phi} & \sim \prod_{i=1}^{n_y} \sum_{b=1}^B \phi_b \sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk} \operatorname{N} \left( \tilde{y}_i \middle| \mu_{bk}, \sigma_{bk}^2 \right),
\end{align*}

where the notation $\{\boldsymbol\theta_b\}_{b=1}^{B}$ denotes the set of parameters $\{ \boldsymbol\theta_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol\theta_B\}$.

\subsection{Top-down mixing prior model}
\label{mix:prior}


<!-- Consider the latent, unknown age of a single mineral grain from either the child $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}$ or one of the $b = 1, \ldots, B$ parents $\tilde{\mathbf{z}}_b$. We assign the range of mineral ages for the $k$th formation event the base probability distribution $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk})$ which depends on parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk}$. There are many possible choices for the base distribution $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk})$; we assume a normal distribution $N(\mu_{bk}, \sigma^2_{bk})$ with mean $\mu_{bk}$ and variance $\sigma^2_{bk}$, therefore $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk} = (\mu_{bk}, \sigma^2_{bk})'$. Other possible choices include a log-normal or gamma distribution that enforces a positive support on the observed age dates or a skew-t distribution \citep{jasra2006bayesian}. Because we assume the age distribution of a single mineral formation event is relatively short with respect to the overall time of interest, the variance parameters that model the duration of the mineral formation events $\sigma^2_{bk}$ will be small relative to the scale of the observed age distribution. Note that the variance $\sigma^2_{bk}$ represents the process variance due to mineral formation events and is different than the measurement process uncertainties ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_y$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_{z_b}$ which is fixed and known. -->
<!-- However, as discussed later, the model will be restricted to consider a common set of shared formation events among the parents where the probability of any parent containing sediments created by any single formation event could be vanishingly small if that formation event did not occur in the catchment of sediments for that parent. -->

The conceptual process model assumes the number of mineral formation events $K$ is known. In practice, the number of formation events is unknown and is a parameter to be estimated. In fact, it is likely that the different parent sites will have different numbers of mineral formation events based on site-specific history. The prior model addresses the fundamental question of estimating the number of mineral formation events.

There are a variety of potential approaches to model the unknown number of formation events. First, one can treat the number of formation events as a fixed parameter, perform a grid search over the different number of formation events, and choose the model that best fits the data based on some information theoretic criteria \citep{miller2018mixture}. A second approach is to sample over the latent unknown number of formation events using a reversible jump algorithm \citep{green1995reversible}. The third approach is to assign a Dirichlet process prior over the number of formation events. The Dirichlet process estimates an unknown number of components without *a priori* specifying the number.

The Dirichlet process is an infinite dimensional stochastic process which is a distribution over distributions \citep{ferguson1973bayesian}. We assign the range of mineral ages for the $k$th formation event the base probability distribution $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk})$ which depends on parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk}$. There are many possible choices for the base distribution $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk})$; we assume a normal distribution $N(\mu_{bk}, \sigma^2_{bk})$ with mean $\mu_{bk}$ and variance $\sigma^2_{bk}$, therefore $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk} = (\mu_{bk}, \sigma^2_{bk})'$. Other possible choices include a log-normal or gamma distribution that enforces a positive support on the observed age dates or a skew-t distribution that allows for asymmetry in the duration of formation events \citep{jasra2006bayesian}. While other distributions are possible, and may better capture the effects of natural dispersion in geochronometers, we rely on normal distributions here to minimize the number of model parameters and emphasize inclusion of the multiple parent and children sediments withing the bottom-up unmixing framework. Because we assume the age distribution of a single mineral formation event is relatively short with respect to the overall time of interest, the variance parameters that model the duration of the mineral formation events $\sigma^2_{bk}$ will be small relative to the scale of the observed age distribution. Note that the variance $\sigma^2_{bk}$ represents the process variance due to mineral formation events and is different than the measurement process variances, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_y$ and $\{ \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_{z_b} \}_{b=1}^B$, which are fixed and known.

We use the stick-breaking representation of a Dirichlet process 

\begin{align*}
\numberthis\label{eq:stick}
\sum_{k=1}^\infty p_{bk} G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk}),
\end{align*}

where $p_{bk}$ are the positive mixing weights with $\sum_{k=1}^\infty p_{bk} = 1$. In practice, $p_{bk} \approx 0$ for large $k$, therefore, the infinite sum is well approximated by the finite sum $\sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk}$ for a large enough $K$ (for most problems K=10 or K=20 is sufficiently large). The stick-breaking representation for $\mathbf{p}_b$ is constructed by transforming auxiliary variables $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_b=(\tilde{p}_{b1}, \ldots, \tilde{p}_{b K-1})'$ using the stick-breaking representation 

\begin{align*}
p_{b k} & = \begin{cases}
\tilde{p}_{b1} & \mbox{for } k = 1,\\
 \tilde{p}_{bk} \prod_{k'=1}^{k-1} (1 - \tilde{p}_{bk'}) & \mbox{for } k=2, \ldots, K-1, \\ 
\prod_{k'=1}^{k-1} (1 - p_{bk'}) & \mbox{for } k = K.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Priors on the $\tilde{p}_{bk}$ are assigned exchangeable $\operatorname{Beta}(1, \alpha_b)$ priors giving rise to the stick-breaking Dirichlet process. The hyperparameters $\alpha_b$ are given exchangeable $\operatorname{Gamma}(1, 1)$ priors that control the Dirichlet process concentration (i.e., smaller $\alpha_b$ give fewer formation events, larger $\alpha_b$ give more formation events). Because our study site is constrained geographically, the parent and child sites contain mineral grains derived from common formation events. As such, we follow \citet{lock2015shared} and used shared kernels by letting $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{bk} \equiv \boldsymbol{\theta}_k = (\mu_k, \sigma^2_k)'$ for all $b=1, \ldots, B$. In theory, there could be no overlap at all among the formation events, although in this situation it would be possible to choose a $K$ that is large enough such that the number of shared kernels is larger than the total number of formation events among the parents and would result in equivalent inference. 

The mixing kernel means $\mu_k$ are assigned vague, independent $N(\mu_{\mu}, \sigma^2_{\mu})$ priors with $\mu_{\mu} = 150$ Million years (Myr) and $\sigma^2_{\mu} = 150^2$ Myr$^2$. The standard deviations for the ages of formation are assigned truncated half-Cauchy priors $\sigma_k \sim \operatorname{Cauchy}^+(0, s)I\{0 < \sigma_k < \omega\}$, where we choose $s$ to be small relative to the range of dates observed and $\omega$ provides an upper limit to the duration of formation events. For the case study where the majority of dates span the range of 0 to about 300 Myr, we set s to be 25 Myr and set $\omega$ to be 50 Myr. The truncation is important to prevent the Dirichlet process mixture from generating unrealistically long formation events which does not match our *a priori* geologic knowledge.


The mixing parameter $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is assigned a $\operatorname{Dirichlet}(\alpha_\phi \mathbf{1})$ prior where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones and the hyperparameter $\alpha_\phi$ is assigned a $\operatorname{Gamma}(1, 1)$ prior. When $\alpha_\phi$ is small the mixing proportions concentrate with a large probability on a single parent component. When $\alpha_\phi$ is one $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ will be uniformly distributed over all possible mixing proportions, When $\alpha_\phi$ is large the mixing proportion will be concentrated at equal mixing proportions $\left( \frac{1}{B}, \ldots, \frac{1}{B} \right)$. 


\subsection{Top-down mixing posterior distribution}

The top-down mixing model posterior distribution is 

\begin{align*}
\numberthis\label{eq:posterior}
& \left[ \mathbf{\tilde{y}}, \{ \mathbf{\tilde{z}}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2, \{ \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \boldsymbol{\phi}, \alpha_\phi, \boldsymbol{\alpha} \middle| \mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_y, \{ \mathbf{z}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_b \}_{b=1}^{B} \right] \propto \\
& \hspace{3cm} \left[\mathbf{y} \middle| \mathbf{\tilde{y}}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_y \right]
\prod_{b=1}^B \left[\mathbf{z}_b \middle| \mathbf{\tilde{z}}_b, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_b \right] \times \\
& \hspace{3cm} 
\left[ \mathbf{\tilde{y}} \middle| \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2, \{ \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \boldsymbol{\phi} \right]
\prod_{b=1}^B 
\left[ \mathbf{\tilde{z}}_b \middle| \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2, \boldsymbol{p}_b \right] \times\\
& \hspace{3cm} 
\left[ \boldsymbol{\mu} \right]
\left[ \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2 \right]
\left[ \boldsymbol{\phi} | \alpha_{\phi} \right]
\left[ \alpha_{\phi} \right]
\left( \prod_{b=1}^B \left[ \boldsymbol{p}_b \middle| \alpha_b \right]
\left[ \alpha_b \right]
 \right),
\end{align*}

where each line on the right hand side of the proportional symbol is the data, process, and prior model, respectively. We estimate the posterior using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the _R_ package _NIMBLE_ \citep{nimble2017} using an adaptive block Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \citep{haario2001adaptive}. The constrained auxiliary variables $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_b$ and standard deviations $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2$ are transformed to unconstrained support (logit- and log-scale transformations) for tuning the Metropolis-Hastings block proposals, with corresponding Jacobian adjustments to the acceptance probabilities. The sampling of the sum-to-one mixing proportion $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is performed by introducing auxiliary variables $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, assigning a stick-breaking prior on $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$, then sampling on a logit-scale after correcting for the transformation using the Jacobian to induce a $\operatorname{Dirichlet}(\alpha_\phi \mathbf{1})$ prior on $\boldsymbol{\phi}$.



\section{Bottom-up unmixing model}
The second research question is: can we reconstruct unobserved parent age distributions from multiple child observations? In previous work, this analysis has been variably termed "end-member mixing analysis", "end-member modeling", or "end-member analysis" as applied to unmixing grain size or detrital age distributions \citep{sharman2017sediment,saylor2019characterizing}. The end-member unmixing model has two components. First, the number of parents $B$ is unknown and needs to be estimated. Second, given the number of parents $B$, what are the unobserved mineral formation age distributions for the $B$ parents? For this paper, we assume the number of parents $B$ is known. There are a number of criteria for selecting the number of parents including using Bayesian information criteria, reversible jump MCMC \citep{jasra2006bayesian}, assuming a Dirichlet process over the number of parents, or fitting a mixture of finite mixtures \citep{miller2018mixture}. Rather than explore these ideas, we devote our effort on developing the unmixing model for a fixed number of parents. The end-member model uses the same general framework presented in the mixture of Gaussians model (\ref{eq:posterior}) with some modifications. 

\subsection{Bottom-up unmxing data model}

Let $d=1, \ldots, D$ index the $D$ child sediments that are each composed of $i=1, \ldots, n_d$ samples. As before, we assume a Gaussian measurement distribution for child $d$ given by 

\begin{align*}
\mathbf{y}_d | \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_d, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_d \sim \operatorname{N}(\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{d}, \operatorname{diag} ( \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_{d}) ),
\end{align*}

where $\mathbf{\tilde{y}}_{d}$ is the true, unobserved $n_d$-vector of sediment dates and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{d}$ is a fixed and known $n_d$-vector of reported dating standard deviations.

Unlike in the top-down mixing model above, none of the parent $\mathbf{z}$s are observed. Hence, the parent distributions are estimated entirely using child sediment observations. Assuming a fixed and known number of parents $B$, the bottom-up process model for a mineral grain age arising from the $d$th child is 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:unmix}
\tilde{y}_{id} | \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma^2}, \{ \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \boldsymbol{\phi}_d & \sim \sum_{b=1}^B \phi_{db} \sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk} \operatorname{N}(\mu_{k}, \sigma^2_{k}),
\end{align}

where, like before, we assume a Gaussian mixing distribution using shared kernels across the $B$ parents. The $B$-dimensional mixture proportion $\boldsymbol{\phi}_d = \left( \phi_{d1}, \ldots, \phi_{dB} \right)'$ models the proportion of the $d$th child sediment that can be attributed to each of the $B$ parents. Like the top-down mixing model, these equations can be derived by introducing categorical random variables then marginalizing out the latent indicator variables from the model. The $b$th unknown parent age distribution is given by $\sum_{k=1}^K p_{bk} \operatorname{N}(\mu_{k}, \sigma^2_{k})$. The prior model for the bottom-up unmixing model is the same as for the top-down mixing model, except for the variables have different dimensions.


\subsection{Bottom-up unmixing posterior distribution}
The posterior distribution that we estimate with the end member unmixing model is 

\begin{align*}
\numberthis\label{eq:posterior-unmix}
& \left[ \{ \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_d \}_{d=1}^D, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2, \{ \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B, \{ \boldsymbol{\phi}_d \}_{d=1}^D, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\alpha} \middle| \{ \mathbf{y}_d, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2_{d} \}_{d=1}^D \right] \propto \\
& \hspace{3cm} \prod_{d=1}^D \left[\mathbf{y}_d \middle| \mathbf{\tilde{y}}_d, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{d} \right] \times \\
& \hspace{3cm} 
\prod_{d=1}^D \left[ \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_d \middle| \boldsymbol{\phi}_d, \{ \boldsymbol{p}_b \}_{b=1}^B , \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right] \times \\
& \hspace{3cm} 
\left[ \boldsymbol{\mu}\right]
\left[ \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2 \right]
\left( \prod_{b=1}^B \left[ \boldsymbol{p}_b \middle| \alpha_b \right]
\left[ \alpha_b \right] \right)
\left( \prod_{d=1}^D \left[ \boldsymbol{\phi}_d | \alpha_{\phi d} \right]
\left[ \alpha_{\phi d} \right] \right),
\end{align*}

where the priors are the same as those in (\ref{eq:posterior}) except that there are now $D$ children which implies there are now $D$ $\alpha_{\phi d}$s. Likewise, the MCMC algorithm is the same as presented in Sect. \ref{mix} except for a change in dimension for some parameters.

\label{fig:simulation}
\end{figure}

We explore the performance of the model using a synthetic detrital age distribution dataset. The aim of the simulation study is to understand how the model performs using realistic data and verify the model is capable of recovering the simulated parameters. The simulation study framework can also be used to understand how uncertainty in estimation varies with respect to sample size, variability in the data, and consequences of prior assumptions, although these details are not explored in this work \citep{vehtari2015efficient}. For example, by simulating data with smaller sample sizes than observed, the impact on the uncertainty estimates can be explored and perhaps used to guide sample size recommendations for the collection of new data. Similarly, simulations with different observation errors can be used to quantify the amount of analytic precision needed for an inferential question analogous to how sample size and power calculations can be used in experimental design.

For the simulation study, a synthetic dataset is created using the top-down mixing model in (\ref{eq:posterior}) for $B=3$ parents and a single child (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}a). The parent distributions were composed of 200, 250, and 150 simulated sediment grains, respectively, and the child distribution was composed of 150 sediment grains. In simulation, we used dating uncertainties ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}_y, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_z$) that were about 1-3\% of the total range of the simulated age distribution of 0-400 Myr. These are similar to measurement uncertainties in the case study and demonstrate the model is capable of accounting for measurement uncertainty.

The posterior samples for the mixing proportion $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:simulation2} in hexagonal bins with blue shading proportional to the posterior density \citep{ggtern}, and the simulated mixing proportion is represented by the orange triangle. The simulated mixing proportion (orange triangle) lies within the region of high posterior density demonstrating that the model is accurately estimating the mixing proportions. Figure \ref{fig:simulation3} shows the estimated cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) with posterior samples in red and the simulated CDF in black. The results in Fig. \ref{fig:simulation} demonstrate that the model is accurately estimating the simulated mixing proportions $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ as well as the parent age distributions, validating the effectiveness of the top-down mixing model to recover simulated parameters of interest.

\label{fig:sim-unmix}
\end{figure}

The second simulation generated data from the bottom-up, end-member unmixing model (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}b) to test how well the proposed framework can reconstruct unobserved parent distributions from a set of child observations. For the simulation, we used $B=3$ parents and $D=20$ children where each child consisted of 250 measured sediment grains following the model in (\ref{eq:posterior-unmix}). The range of simulated mixing proportions was simulated uniformly over the three-dimensional simplex resulting in some end members being close to pure end members (e.g., close to 90% of sediment grains coming from a single parent). The dating uncertainties ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}_y$) were set at about 1-3\% of the total range of the simulated age distribution of 0-400 Myr. 

Figure \ref{fig:sim-unmix2} shows the posterior samples for the mixing proportion of each child in hexagonal bins with shading in blue proportional to posterior density and the orange triangle shows the simulated mixing proportion. Based on the simulation study, the model can recover the mixing proportions in this simulation example with high accuracy as the orange triangle is within regions of high posterior mass. Even though the model uses none of the data from the parents, the bottom-up unmixing model produces reasonable end-member parent age distribution estimates. Figure \ref{fig:sim-unmix3} shows the estimated CDF produced by the bottom-up unmixing model which shows the model is estimating the unobserved parent distributions. However, the precision for the bottom-up unmixing model is lower in the bottom-up unmixing simulation relative to the the top-down mixture simulation despite the bottom-up umixing simulated data containing many more sediment grain samples.

\label{fig:parents-data}
\end{figure}
We apply the top-down mixing and bottom-up unmixing models to a well-constrained modern dataset from the central California coast \citep{sickmann2016detrital} shown in Fig. \ref{fig:map}. Following the same mixing framework presented in \citet{sharman2017sediment}, there are five samples (river and beach sediment) used to characterize three distinct sediment inputs (parents) to the region, each with a distinct detrital age distribution. Parents 1 and 2 (P1 and P2) are comprised of river samples (CAR and SAL) that represent sediment sources along the Big Sur coastline and Salinas River drainage, respectively. Parent 3 (P3) is comprised of two river samples (SNR and PAR) and one beach sample (ANB) that represent northern sediment sources in the Santa Cruz Mountains and western Diablo Range \citep{sickmann2016detrital,sharman2017sediment}. Twelve child samples (beach and submarine canyon sediment) are used to characterize how these parents are mixed in littoral and marine environments. In total, this dataset (Fig. \ref{fig:parents-data}) consists of 4,026 individual detrital zircon U-Pb analyses, with individual samples having 82 to 316 analyses each (median of 290 analyses per sample) \citep{sickmann2016detrital}. The age range of the case study data covered approximately 80-3000 Myr; however, there were very few observation older than 300 Myr (approximately 6% of the data) so even though the model was fit to the entire age range, the presentation of results focuses on the period 0-300 Myr to better interpret the results.

\label{fig:mixing-density}
\end{figure}

We first examine the top-down mixture model (Fig. \ref{fig:cartoon}a). Figure \ref{fig:ternary} shows the reconstruction of the mixing proportions for a sample from a submarine canyon (T693) modeled as a mixture of the three specified parent distributions (P1-P3). Visual inspection of the histograms of the data (Fig. \ref{fig:parents-data}) would suggest that this child sample is a mixture composed mostly of P3 with some contribution from P2. The posterior estimates of the mixing proportion of each parent for child T693 confirms that the primary component of the mixture is from the P3 with parent P2 as the secondary component (Fig. \ref{fig:ternary}). Figure \ref{fig:mixing-cdf-data} shows the model is capturing the basic patterns in the parent CDFs as the estimated CDFs are very close to the empirical CDFs for the parents.

These figures show that the end-member unmixing model is estimating the parameters of interest, but with some inaccuracies due to a lack of identifiability. However, these issues are easily identified by the end user due to the large amount of posterior uncertainty which provides a check on overly strong inferential claims.}
\label{fig:unmixing-density}
\end{figure}


The bottom-up, end-member unmixing model results for the case study data are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:unmixing-density}. The posterior density for the mixing proportions are shown for four children in Fig. \ref{fig:unmixing-child-data} as hexagonal bins with shading in blue proportional to posterior density. The posterior distribution of CDFs for the reconstructed parents in Fig. \ref{fig:unmixing-cdf-data} show that the model is very uncertain about the age distribution for parent P2. This is not a totally unsurprising result as the age distributions for parent P2 and parent P3 are very similar and thus are difficult to tease apart in an unsupervised learning situation like that in the bottom-up unmixing model. In Fig. \ref{fig:unmixing-child-data} the mixture probability for child T693 is more concentrated at P3 when compared to the top-down mixing proportion estimates in Fig. \ref{fig:ternary}. Because the model expresses uncertainty about the distribution of parent P2, the difference in estimation between the top-down and bottom-up mixing proportions for child T693 can be attributed to this lack of identifiability among parents P2 and P3. Similar to how the important variables in a linear regression can change with small perturbations of the data when the covariates are highly co-linear (i.e., in models with a high variance inflation factor), the attribution of the child sediment to a given parent would change which parent distribution (P2 or P3) is estimated with accuracy and which parent shows evidence of non-identifiability. Thus, the non-identifiability manifests as large posterior uncertainty in the CDF for parent P2 and provides a caution about being overly confident in the inference about the bottom-up unmixing model.

A large overlap in the distribution of parent ages is a feature that often occurs in detrital zircon geochronology studies. The preservation of zircons through multiple cycles of erosion and re-sedimentation means that overlapping zircon ages will be present in many rocks. For parent age distributions that are quite similar to one another, the reconstruction of the unknown parent distributions suffers from weak identifiability. In these situations, the estimated parents jointly contain all of the formation events, but the model is unable to attribute the formation events to the correct parents. In other words, while the model identifies the correct age components, the model sometimes struggles to correctly group these components into the correct parent distributions. This aliasing effect is not an unexpected result because Bayesian nonparametric models are well understood to suffer from non-identifiability issues \citep{ferguson1983bayesian,diebolt1994estimation,richardson1997bayesian,fruhwirth2006finite}. 

Non-identifiability is inherent in all end-member unmixing models \citep{weltje2007genetically}. To overcome the non-identifiability in other modeling frameworks, a potential solution is to impose constraints on the end-members and/or provide informative initial conditions for maximum likelihood optimization algorithms \citep{donoho2004does,miao2007endmember,chen2012hals}. Therefore, any end-member unmixing model that uses only child age distributions will have issues in accurately reconstructing the parent distributions if the assumption of the constraints is not met (i.e., the parent age distributions are structurally similar). Bottom-up unmixing models provide a useful way to explore large detrital datasets with unknown sedimentary sources. Our proposed model framework provides a way to identify those datasets that either are or are not susceptible to non-identifiability by producing uncertainty estimates that are larger when the model is weakly identifiable (Fig. \ref{fig:unmixing-cdf-data}, parent 2). Thus, the uncertainty intervals are a useful diagnostic check for identifiability.

Direct, probabilistic estimates of uncertainty and the ability to calculate derived quantities with uncertainty is a benefit of the proposed method and of Bayesian methods in general. Thus, we can answer questions like what is the probability that at least 50\% of child sediment T693 comes from parent P3 using the top-down mixing model applied to the case study data? The answer is calculated directly from the posterior samples using the Monte Carlo approximation $\frac{1}{L} \sum_{\ell=1}^L I\{ \phi_{3}^{(\ell)} \geq 0.5\} = 0.672$, where $\ell=1, \ldots, L$ are the indices of the MCMC samples and $\phi_{\mbox{P3}}^{(\ell)}$ is the estimated mixing proportion for the $\ell$th MCMC iteration. The probability that at least 50\% of the child sediment comes from parent P3 and at least 25\% comes from parent P2 is $\frac{1}{L} \sum_{\ell=1}^L I\{ \phi_{\mbox{P3}}^{(\ell)} \geq 0.5 \} \times I\{ \phi_{\mbox{P2}}^{(\ell)} \geq 0.25 \}= 0.283$. Another question of interest that can be expressed in term of the model is "How many mineral formation events occurred for each parent?" We assumed that there was an upper bound of $K$ possible mineral formation events for each parent distribution modeled by the $K$-dimensional probability vector $\mathbf{p}_b$ for each of the $B$ parents. For a given parent $b$ and a fixed threshold $\tau$ where we conclude that a potential formation event is realized (say $\tau$ = 0.01 or $\tau$ = 0.05), the estimated number of formation events is $\frac{1}{L} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \sum_{k=1}^K I\{ p_{bk}^{(\ell)} \geq \tau\}$. For example, the posterior mean estimate for the number of formation events for parent P1 under the top-down mixing model is 4.37 (95% CI 4-6) when the threshold $\tau = 0.05$ and 8.34 (95% CI 7-10) when $\tau = 0.01$. Because the model produces a posterior probability, any other such probabilistic questions like those above can be calculated as derived quantities. For example, we can ask questions like: what proportion of a given sample contains grains older than a given age? or what is the probability that an unobserved parent contains grains within a particular age range. Once the posterior samples have been calculated, any questions that can be evaluated using derived quantities can be answered probabilistically.

In addition, the ability to include prior information in the Bayesian framework is a useful tool that can be used to improve estimation and test geologic hypotheses. For example, certain geologic events, such as the Grenville orogeny, produced large amounts of zircon that have since been broadly dispersed and recycled in sedimentary rocks \citep{moecher2006differential}. Priors that account for the likelihood of observing zircons of Grenville-age (or other known zircon-producing events) can be introduced into this model framework to improve performance. In addition, our framework can accommodate a variety of detrital data with different magnitudes of uncertainty. As analytic techniques for dating minerals improve, it is important to account for dating uncertainties that might have orders of magnitude difference, making our method more robust to future improvements in analytic laboratory techniques.

\section{Conclusion}

Starting from a conceptual model of how sediments mix over a landscape, we developed a generative Bayesian nonparametric statistical model for detrital mineral age data. This model allows us to characterize the uncertainty in the age distributions of parents and children and the mixing proportions for sediments while explicitly accounting for the uncertainties in measured dates \citep{jasra2006bayesian,tye2019bayesian}. Because the model can generate sediment age distributions, we can directly explore the assumptions of the model by simulating synthetic data. Running a simulation experiment demonstrated the model is capable of recovering simulated distributions which supports the usefulness of the framework when applied to observed data. 

We proposed two frameworks to model the sediment mixing mechanisms: the top-down mixing model where mineral dates are measured for both parent and child sediments and a bottom-up unmixing framework where mineral dates are only measured for the children. The top-down model estimated the parent and child distributions and the mixing proportions with high precision and accuracy. The bottom-up model occasionally showed evidence of non-identifiability in the simulation experiments and did show non-identifiability in the case study, suggesting the inference for the bottom-up model is less precise than for the top-down mixing model. Because the variances of these estimates are larger in our bottom-up unmixing model, the user is provided with feedback about the potential pitfalls in being overly confident about the reconstructed parent distributions. 


Obtaining correct inference is vitally important for any statistical model. However, many models make identifying when inference is suspect challenging. The explicit modeling of uncertainty presented in this manuscript provides a check on overly confident inference. As such, the inference in the model presented herein provides a useful diagnostic on the quality of model fit. In the case study, the posterior distribution for one of the parent distributions was estimated with a large amount of uncertainty. Therefore, the inference based on the model fit is less reliable than the model that includes the parent data. Thus, explicit modeling of uncertainty is critical in providing information about the quality of the inference. 


While this manuscript focuses on estimating the mixture of geochronological measurements from sediments, the methods discussed can be applied to mixtures of any univariate variable of interest. For example, the top-down mixing and bottom-up unmixing models can be applied to mixtures of sediment grain size \citep{weltje2007genetically}. In addition to applying the model frameworks to other variables, the extension of the mixing and unmixing models to multivariate data would allow for the inclusion of more nuanced and detailed data. In the cases where the distributions are only weakly identified based on one variable, the mixing distributions might be identifiable using other variables. Thus, the results presented in this manuscript can provide a roadmap for future development and extension to better characterize geologic landscapes.
