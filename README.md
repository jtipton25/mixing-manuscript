# Supplement to: A mechanistic approach to unmixing detrital geochonologic data using Bayesian nonparametric mixture models

## Authors: John Tipton, Glenn Sharman, and Samuel Johnstone

This repository contains code and data to replicate the analyses found in the manuscript *A mechanistic approach to unmixing detrital geochonologic data using Bayesian nonparametric mixture models* by John Tipton, Glenn Sharman, and Samuel Johnstone.

Clone the entire repository and open the project in RStudio using the file mixing-mansucript.Rproj.

Once the project is open, you can run the main scripts in the manuscript folder. First, open Appendix.Rmd in the RStudio project and knit this file. Then you can compile the main manuscript document titled mixing.Rmd

## Outline of the files

The primary files are in the manuscript folder are

- Appendix.Rmd
- mixing.Rmd

The file Appendix.Rmd runs analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

The file mixing.Rmd is the body of the manuscript. This must be knit after Appendix.Rmd
